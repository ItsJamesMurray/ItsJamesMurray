### What I'm Currently Working On:

According to Fender, 90% of beginner guitar players give up within a year.  I wholly believe in-person instruction is much better than online, pre-recorded, content when trying to truly help new guitarists get past their first chords.

With Strumm, you can do your research on instructors before signing up for lessons. We'll also provide resources for instructors so they can focus on teaching their students, such as billing, scheduling, and finding new students.

### What I do daily

I founded Prism.  We are a data driven digital marketing agency run by former Googlers and former media execs.  Our goal is to help our clients fully capture their first party data, and leverage that into marketing decision making.
