## Hi there, I'm James Murray!

I'm a self-taught problem solver with experience in sales, marketing, operations, and finance at big tech companies like Google and Amazon. I've also started and sold a business as an owner. These days, I use my experience to solve complex marketing problems for my clients.

### About me
I am a partner at [Pivotal Consulting Group](https://www.pcg.xyz/?utm_source=github_readme), where we build robust measurement solutions and customized go-to-market strategies. We provide the tools and know-how to unlock your businessâ€™ growth potential and stay competitive in todayâ€™s ever-changing marketplace. Our goal is to help our clients fully capture their first party data and leverage that into marketing decision making.

### My favorite project

According to Fender, 90% of beginner guitar players give up within a year.  I wholly believe in-person instruction is much better than online, pre-recorded, content when trying to truly help new guitarists get past their first chords.

With [Strumm](https://www.strumm.co), you can do your research on instructors before signing up for lessons. We'll also provide resources for instructors so they can focus on teaching their students, such as billing, scheduling, and finding new students.

Building Strumm (documented [here](https://www.itsjamesmurray.com/blog/building-strumm-my-first-vue-app/?utm_source=github_readme)) was a ton of fun and helped me work on building a fully functional tool -- this included design, backend engineering, and using a number of frontend frameworks to have my vision come to life.
