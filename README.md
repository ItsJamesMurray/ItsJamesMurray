### What I'm Currently Working On:

According to Fender, 90% of beginner guitar players give up within a year.  I wholly believe in-person instruction is much better than online, pre-recorded, content when trying to truly help new guitarists get past their first chords.

With Strumm, you can do your research on instructors before signing up for lessons. We'll also provide resources for instructors so they can focus on teaching their students, such as billing, scheduling, and finding new students.
